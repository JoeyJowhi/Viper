# Viper
A collection of my personal (mainly Python) projects I like to tinker with on my downtime.

## Viperan
This is a small text-based RPG style game I began working on last month.
Inspired by titles such as Fear and Hunger, earlier Final Fantasy entries and Zork.

## Blackjack
As the title suggests, this is simply a text based blackjack program with
the Python random library as the dealer.
